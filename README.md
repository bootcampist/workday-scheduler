## Usage

Each time slot contains a text area, allowing for items to be entered next to the relevant time. The items are saved once the button is pressed and stored in local storage. The time blocks are colour-coded to show dark grey for past hours, light grey for future ones and red for the current time. Using JavaScript, the colours are automatically updated every hour.
