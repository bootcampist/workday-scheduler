## Description

The Workday Scheduler is a scheduling application using JQuery and Day.js. It allows for items to be input in timeslots and stored in local Storage for retrieval after the page has been refreshed. The order of the timeslots can be changed by dragging and dropping. Afterwards, clicking the time of the corresponding timeslot updates the times of all timeslots allowing them to be once again in chronological order. It also saves the rearrranged position of the input.

## Usage

Each time slot contains a text area, allowing for items to be entered next to the relevant time. The items are saved once the button is pressed and stored in local storage. The timeslots are colour-coded to show dark grey for past hours, light grey for future ones and red for the current time. Using JavaScript, the colours are automatically updated every hour. The date displayed at the top of the page also updates to the current day.
